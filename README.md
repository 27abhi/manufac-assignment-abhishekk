## Things I've implemented

1.) Implemented in Typescript.\
2.) The tables are dynamic in nature, that is the number of columns and rows will be dynamically created as per number of classes available in JSON data.\
3.) Javascript functions used - For-loops, ForEach, Map, Filter\
4.) Some basic styling applied on the tables.\
\
Do let me know if I have missed implementing something in a certain manner as it was required.
